# Delta
Manufactured and programmed a Delta robot from scratch. My main roles included the use of a CNC milling machine, a conventional milling machine, and a conventional lathe machine to create the mechanical components of the robot. The source material used was aliminum. My second role in the team was to adapt the teams exosteing PLC code to fucntion with a microcontroller (ESP32) with an integrated wifi module. The purpose of using this microcontroller was to create a webpage, and connect the microcontroller to the internet so anyone in the wolrd could potentially move the Delta robot.
