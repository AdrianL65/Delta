# Delta
Manufactured and programmed a Delta robot from scratch. This robot is the result of a group project over the course of a semetser. The objectve was to design, manufacture and program a delta robot with the task of doing a 'pick and place'routine with a bottle cap; the robot's vision would be done via an industrial camera. The robot was to be programmed with a Siemmens 1200 PLC; used two stepper motors and switched-mode power source. My main roles included the use of a CNC milling machine, a conventional milling machine, and a conventional lathe machine to create the mechanical components of the robot. The source material used was aliminum. My second role in the team was to adapt the teams existing PLC code to fucntion with a microcontroller (ESP32) with an integrated wifi module. The purpose of using this microcontroller was to create a webpage, and connect the microcontroller to the internet so anyone in the wolrd could potentially move the Delta robot via a web page. 
In this repository one can find the code implemented; picture and video footage of the manufacturing proccess, the webpage and the robot's functionality.
